# EDA-And-FE-GooglePlaystore
In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on the Google Play Store dataset, dissecting 10,841 records across 20 columns to uncover patterns and insights
âœ… Which category dominates the store?
 âœ… Which app has the most installs?
 âœ… Which app has the largest size?
ðŸ”Ž Key Findings:
 ðŸ“Œ 271 apps boast a perfect 5-star rating.
 ðŸ“Œ The top-rated app is "CT Brain Interpretation" from the Family category.
This project sharpened my ability to clean, transform, and visualize large datasetsâ€”reinforcing the importance of data-driven decision-making. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), I tackled missing values, optimized feature selection, and refined insights to make sense of app trends.
